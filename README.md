PVsyst Simulation Example

This is an example of using PVsyst 7.4 to design a solar panel system at a site in Seattle Washington.  

The PDF has the default report from PVsyst.
The .docx file has a detailed description of the site, simulation methodogoly, and design decisions.

A few topics analyzed and discussed include within the project include:
- Site drawings
- House and solar panel structural modelling
- Shading analysis and simulation
- Panel and inverter selection and economics
- Overall economics of project
- System price estimate 
- Payback period estimation
- Energy generation estimates over 30 years
